# nhu

Fragment shader live coding environment.

Features:

* Edit `fragment.glsl` and see changes reflected in almost real-time
* Live-view webserver allows you to share your work with multiple viewers
* Run `nhu -gl` for a native OpenGL window if you don't like browsers


Available uniforms:

* `vec2 u_resolution` for width/height
* `float u_time` in seconds


Future ideas:

* More stuff
* Webserver with editor?
